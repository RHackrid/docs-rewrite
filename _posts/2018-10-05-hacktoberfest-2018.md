We're pretty big on open source here at Mycroft, and we're also hosted on <a href="https://digitalocean.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Ocean</a>. So it's no surprise that we're participating again this year in <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacktoberfest</a>. Hacktoberfest - now into its fifth year - is a month-long coding festival hosted by Digital Ocean, in collaboration with partners <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and, this year, <a href="https://twilio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio.</a> The festival is aimed at encouraging more people - from all walks of life - to get into coding. Importantly, it also encourages contributing back to the open source software they use and love.
